# An Introduction to Combinatorial Optimization with Gurobi
## Description
The content of this repo was created in the context of the course of Optimisation Combinatoire et Stochastique at MINES ParisTech, PSL University.

It leverages Gurobi to solve an example combinatorial optimization problem.

## Getting started
You can simply get started with the PDF file "documentation.pdf" describing the different questions that will be tackled in this project. The notebook *electrical_power_generation.ipynb* contain the math and the code necessary to solve the different problems.

## License
The PDF "documentation.pdf" is provided here only as a reference, it entirely belongs to the CMA department of Mines ParisTech.
